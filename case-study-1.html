        <h2 class="mb-6">So we crafted a plan</h2>

        <p class="text-lg mb-6">
          I worked alongside Senior Design Manager Greg Rogers to lead the redesign. Our team hypothesized that by reworking the foundation of questions into a flexible, scalable system...

            <li>Empower educators to create better questions</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <p class="text-lg mb-6">
          Analyzing customer feedback and working closely with our internal Textbook Authoring team via biweekly brainstorming meetings allowed us to workshop initial design concepts and helped to inform the scope and design for our MVP.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg mb-6">
          Before diving into designs, I pulled together an in-depth audit of the existing questions framework. We found that existing question forms were inconsistent with no universal components causing questions to render differently across the app.

      <div class="case-study-section fade-in">
        <h2 class="mb-6">"How can we simplify this?"</h2>

        <p class="text-lg mb-6">
          Through our investigation we determined that the lifecycle of a question in Top Hat could be distilled into two main sections: authoring & rendering.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg mb-6">
          We set out to create a single experience for each section, a universal Question Builder where educators could craft questions in a "what you see is what you get" style editor, and a Question Renderer consisting of reusable components to display questions consistently across the app.
        </p>

      <div class="case-study-section fade-in">
        <span class="section-label">Design</span>
        <h2 class="mb-6">A flexible universal Question Builder</h2>

        <p class="text-lg mb-6">
          In order to support the kinds of expressive questions we needed, the Builder had to be flexible. Nothing like this existed in the market so we took inspiration from products like Notion and Confluence where a blank canvas, coupled with interchangeable blocks, allowed for endless customization.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg mb-6">
          This block-based editing system allowed us to leave behind the concept of distinct “question types” opting instead for response blocks that encapsulated functionality. Now, all questions could be created inside a single editor, simplifying the process to add new “question types”. We extended the block idea to features like images; allowing for placement anywhere within a question construction.
        </p>

        <div class="card card-bordered p-6 mb-8">
          <p class="text-lg" style="font-style: italic;">
            In the new foundation, <b>any feature added to the universal Question Builder would automatically be available for any question construction</b>, seamlessly integrated across the entire platform, ensuring consistency and scalability.

        <p class="text-lg mb-6">
          While flexibility was ideal for STEM, what we quickly realized through user testing was that users were overwhelmed by a completely blank canvas.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg mb-6">
          To bridge the gap, we introduced fully editable “templates” which could be dropped onto the canvas to provide a guide while maintaining the Builder’s flexible nature.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg mb-6">
          Once a question was authored, the job of our Question Renderer was to create a consistent question experience from this point on.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg mb-6">
          The Renderer was designed as a <b>single component comprised of multiple smaller systems</b> that work together to react to the question’s context and present the relevant information. This ensured questions looked great and worked smoothly anywhere in the app.

        <p class="text-lg mb-6">
          Few things are worse than giant, bloated design files. Greg and I were adamant from the start that, regardless of the projects length and complexity, drowning in dense documentation and clunky files would not be our fate.
        </p>

        <p class="text-lg mb-6">
          Together, we crafted and implemented three strategies that were instrumental in maintaining quality and communication throughout the project.

              <h5 class="process-title">Archiving completed work</h5>
              <p class="process-description">Messy design explorations stayed in their own individual files. Once we agreed on a design decision we added it to our main file via a new branch and archived the exploration file.</p>
              <p class="process-description">We maintained one main spec file using pages to separate each new feature. We wrote specs as needed and deleted them using branches once completed.</p>

              <h5 class="process-title">Writing our own JIRA tickets</h5>
              <p class="process-description">This kept most written documentation out of our spec files and avoided duplicate work for PMs who would normally translate specs into tickets. It also gave us control over visual requirements and expectations.</p>
